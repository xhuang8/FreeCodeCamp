        <h2>Here is a timeline of Yuan Longping's life.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1930 - On September 7, Yuan Longping was born in Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</li>

            <li>1953 - He graduated from the Department of Agronomy of Southwest Agricultural College (now Southwest University),
                obeyed the unified distribution of the country, and taught at the Anjiang Agricultural School in Huaihua District, Hunan Province.
                In the same year, he was assigned to teach the remote and backward Anjiang Agricultural School of Xiangxi Xuefeng Mountain.</li>

            <li>1953.08~1971.01 - He was a teacher of Anjiang Agricultural School, Hunan Province.</li>

            <li>1960 - In July of 1960, he accidentally discovered a special trait of rice in the agricultural school test field.
                He used the rice plant to test and found that his offspring have different properties.
                Because rice is self-pollinated, there is no trait separation, so he infers that it is natural hybrid rice.
                He then manually removed the male and female rice male flowers and gave another species of pollen to try to produce hybrid varieties.</li>

            <li>1961 - In the spring of 1961, he planted the seeds of this mutant strain into the entrepreneurial test field, and the results proved
                that the plant that was found in the 1960s was a "natural hybrid rice." He was a teacher at Anjiang Civil University, but in the face of
                severe famine at the time, he decided to use agricultural science and technology to defeat the threat of hunger and engage in rice male sterility tests.</li>

            <li>1964 - On July 5, he found a "natural male sterile plant" in the experimental rice field. After artificial pollination,
                he produced hundreds of first-generation male sterile plants.</li>

            <li>1965 - In July of 1965, Yuan Longping inspected 6 sterile plants in more than 14,000 rice ears, and in the next two years of planting, 4 plants were
                successfully propagated for 1 to 2 generations. His research completely overthrew the "sexless hybridization" theory of traditional classical theory
                Miqiulin and Lysenko, and concluded that rice also has a hybrid advantage. The cultivation of hybrid rice by cultivating the male sterile line,
                the male sterile line and the male sterile restorer line can greatly increase rice yield.</li>

            <li>1966 - On February 28, the first paper entitled "Male Infertility of Rice" was published in the 17th issue of the "Science Bulletin", Volume I, Issue 4,
                edited by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In May, Comrade Zhao Qujing, director of the 9th Bureau of the State Science and Technology Commission,
                was informed of the article "Male Infertility of Rice" published by Yuan Longping, and received great attention. He wrote a letter to the
                Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Commission and Anjiang Agricultural School in the name of the 9th Bureau of the Science and Technology Commission.
                Yuan Longping's rice male sterility research activity pointed out that this study is of great significance.
                If successful, it will greatly increase rice production. [18] In June, the Cultural Revolution began, Yuan Longping suffered an impact, and the rice male sterility
                test was forced to be interrupted.</li>

            <li>1967 - In April of 1967, Yuan Longping drafted the “Selection and Breeding Program for Rice Male Infertility in Anjiang Agricultural School” and reported
                it to the Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Science and Technology Committee of Xiangyang District. In June, the Rice Male Infertility
                Research Group, which was composed of Yuan Longping, Li Bihu and Yin Huaqi, was officially established.</li>

            <li>1968 - On April 30, Yuan Longping inserted more than 700 sterile seedlings of infertile materials into the Tianli, No. 7 Zhongguan Pan, Anjiang Agricultural School,
                covering an area of 133 square meters. On the evening of May 18th, the seedlings of sterile materials in the No. 7 field of the Middle Ages were completely removed
                and destroyed, becoming an unbroken mystery. Yuan Longping is heartbroken. On the 4th day after the incident, the remaining 5 seedlings were found in a waste shaft of
                the school and continued to be tested.</li>

            <li>1970 - In the summer of 1970, Yuan Longping introduced wild rice from Yunnan. He planned to do hybridization in Jing County (Anjiang Agricultural School moved to Jing County),
                but it was not successful because of short-light treatment. In the autumn, Yuan Longping led the research team Li Bihu and Yin Huaqi to Nanjiang Farm in Ya County,
                Hainan Island to conduct Hainan, a three-season rice experiment, to conduct research and test, and to investigate the distribution of wild rice to technicians and workers.</li>

            <li>1977 - Yuan Longping published two important papers, "Practice and Theory of Hybrid Rice Cultivation" and "Key Technologies for Hybrid Rice Seed Production and High Yield."</li>

            <li>2017 - In September of 2017, at the on-site observation meeting of the National Rice Variety and New Technology Show in 2017, Yuan Longping announced a new result of eliminating
                heavy metal cadmium in rice: “We have a breakthrough technology in rice breeding recently. The gene containing cadmium or cadmium in the parent 'knocks off', the parent is clean,
                and the seed is naturally clean."</li>

            <li>2019~present - He is still doing his research.</li>
